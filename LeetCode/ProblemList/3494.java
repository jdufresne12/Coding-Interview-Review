/*
  3494. Find the minimum time to brew potions
  You are given two integer arrays, skill and mana, of length n and m, respectively.
  In a laboratory, n wizards must brew m potions in order. Each potion has a mana capacity mana[j] and must pass through all the wizards sequentially to be brewed properly. The time taken by the ith wizard on the jth potion is timeij = skill[i] * mana[j].
  Since the brewing process is delicate, a potion must be passed to the next wizard immediately after the current wizard completes their work. This means the timing must be synchronized so that each wizard begins working on a potion exactly when it arrives. â€‹
  Return the minimum amount of time required for the potions to be brewed properly.

  Example 1:
  Input: skill = [1,5,2,4], mana = [5,1,4,2]
  Output: 110
